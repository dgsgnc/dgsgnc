### Ownership and Leadership in IFE Platform Improvement

Over the past three years, customer usage rates for IFE Platforms reached their lowest point. I took ownership of the issue and managed it end-to-end, achieving the following:

- Organized **56 test flights** and **119 on-site interventions**.
- Led improvements to the in-flight **UI/UX experience** by collaborating with cross-functional teams.
- Resulted in a **significant increase in user interaction rates** from **66% to 95%** in just **four months**.
