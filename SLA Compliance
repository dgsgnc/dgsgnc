### Automated Response Rules Implementation in Jira

To address inefficiencies in issue resolution, I implemented **automated response rules** using **JQL (Jira Query Language)** in Jira. This strategic change led to several improvements:

- **40% reduction in response time**
- **Increased SLA compliance** from **78% to 91%**
- Significant improvement in **resolution times** and **customer satisfaction**

By automating repetitive tasks and triggering alerts, we were able to resolve issues more efficiently and meet service level agreements more effectively, ultimately driving better customer experiences.

#### Example JQL Query:

```JQL
assignee = currentUser() AND status = "In Progress" AND created >= -1w ORDER BY created ASC
